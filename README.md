## DESCRIPTION

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This is an application that uses NODE to generate a README Markdown file based on user input, by asking a series of questions in the comman line.

## INSTALLATION

First, download the files from this repository, then open the terminal. Inside the folder, use 'npm init' to initialize npm package, then 'npm i' to install dependencies. Your project is ready for use!

### USAGE

This application can be invoked by entering the following command into the terminal

```bash
node index.js
```

You will then be given a series of questions to answer. Your responses to these answers will be used to generate your new README file.
